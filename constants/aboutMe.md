Who am I? I’m Khumbo, a 24-year old, Malawian-South African living and working in the UK (it’s a mouthful). I work
as a Mechanical Engineer/Software Developer, but my real passion is all things personal finance and investing. I
started this channel to reach people who, like me, may not have grown up with a financial education but have
realised it’s essential to living life on your terms. End goal: FINANCIAL EDUCATION FOR ALL! Medium goal: taking
you guys along with me through my financial journey. If you’d like to contact me, feel free to email me on
roadtowealth7@gmail.com. Join Road to Wealth and stay tuned for more videos on financial literacy! Disclaimer I do
