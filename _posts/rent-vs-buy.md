Anecdotal and newspaper clippings

1. Buying a house is something everyone who is figuring out their finances thinks about at one point or another. A lot of the time with the voice of someone else telling you it’s the right thing to do. I mean renting is just paying your landlords mortgage or throwing money away or something like that. But is it really?

2. In this video we’re going to weigh up renting and buying to help you decide whether buying a house is really the right choice for you.
   Santander First-Time Buyer Study
3. In May 2019 Santander commissioned research surveying 5,002 UK adults aged 18-40 years who don’t own their own property. The largest study of potential first-time buyers of its kind.
   • British people notoriously love real estate
   • Especially with the recent elimination/reduction of stamp duty sending house prices through the roof. You might be forgiven/someone who wants to buy into this hot investment.
   • Reasons why people want to own a home

4.When the respondents were asked what they would consider to be their top life goals, they listed owning a home above financial stability, starting a family or even being secure in retirement.

5. And when they were asked why owning a home was a key life goal they said…

Since I like looking at the data for my financial decisions, I’m going to address the middle three points. It’s not very easy to find a clear answer when looking at conflicting news articles so let’s take a look at the numbers.

First and foremost, things have changed. Here we have the median house price and the median gross salary of people in the UK. Both rising as between 1997 and 2020 but when we actually look at the ratio of the house prices to the earnings we can see that house prices have increased at a rate far greater than our salaries are. This is significant. When our repeated by our parents and peers that property is always a good investment. Things have changed. Houses were more affordable when your parents were buying their house compared to now, when you’re thinking about buying your house.

6. So owning a home may not be as easy as it once was, but is it still worth it?
7. Next I’m going to be looking at the overall costs of renting and the overall costs of buying. These are the averages according to the Office of National statistics so they may not exactly match your numbers. Although, it’d be good to follow along using your numbers so you can evaluate your own situation.

8. I’ve taken a look at the Money Saving Expert Basic Mortgage calculator to make sure my researched numbers are realistic.
9. Now let’s balance this out to fairly compare our two scenarios.

Now knowing that we spent exactly the same over this 25-year period. One going purely into the house and the other going into a combination of rentals and an S&P investment. How much worth would we have at the end of a 25-year period.

Let’s break down those costs.

10. In all honesty, this is an oversimplification. Your returns can definitely be affected by a number of things including if your S&P investment is in a taxable account, how many times you will move. Try to factor this into your calculations as well.

11. What I’ve described here is opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of buying a home is the potential benefit that someone misses out on when they could’ve chosen to rent and invest in the stock market instead and vice versa.
    There are tons of potential options here, you can decide to rent for a few years then buy after even or you might decide to live with your parents.

12. The point of this is not to give you a definitive answer but it is to help you think about some of the things you were taught growing up. Do the same with your numbers so that can you decide whether buying or renting is best for your circumstances. Also think about what you really want for your life. Not just what other expect of you.
13. I hope this has helped you think of more factors to consider when deciding to buy or rent. This a huge financial decision and its impact could reach into other parts of your life.

Whichever you decide, you need to make sure you’re in control of your money and not the other way around, put it to work so that can be financially free one day.

UK Stamp Duty Holiday
In order to bolster up the housing market the UK government intoruduced a stamp duty holiday in July 2020. Until 30 June 2021, there is no Stamp Duty on properties costing up to £500,000 for everyone (first-time buyer or have previously owned a property). From 1 July to 30 September 2021, you will not have to pay Stamp Duty on residential properties costing up to £250,000 or£ 300,000 if you’re a first-time buyer.

Reason for this post
Since I like looking at the data when making financial decisions, let look a bit deeper into these three points.
What you might feel about buying
Advantages
• Your monthly payment will in most cases go to equity in your home so if property prices rise, you would be seeing a return
• Your mortgage payments will eventually end with you owning your home outright
• And a big one here, you won’t have to deal with a landlord or have to ask for permission for anything. And as long as you keep paying your bills, nobody will come to kick you out.

What you might feel about renting
Advantages
• You only have to have a small deposit to rent although your landlord could decide to keep all or a part of it.
• Renting means you are flexible and can more easily switch between places
• Your landlord is responsible for maintenance, repairs and renovations, not you
• Rental prices tend to be cheaper than mortgages.
• And if property prices go down, it’s not your problem
• We know that time in the market is the biggest factor when it comes to investing, renting might allow you to invest in the market earlier on
You can clearly see that these are two sides of the coin, ones positive is the other’s negative with very little in between. So rent or buy? Now that up to you… Let’s take a look at the numbers.
