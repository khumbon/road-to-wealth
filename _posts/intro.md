My name is Khumbo and this is Road to Wealth, I started this channel so that I can keep track of my own journey to wealth while hopefully taking a few people along with me. I truly understand the experience of not growing up with any sort of personal finance experience and having this fear of money. So, in my own messy way I’d like to show you how I got from being someone who did not believe that money belonged in my pocket to someone who knows that wealth is mine for the taking. Then together we can figure out how to reach that goal of financial and time wealth. I am by no means perfect but I think imperfect people deserve wealth too. So I’m giving myself the challenge of documenting my Road to Wealth for the world to see. And hopefully I’ll take a few people along with me. If you’re interested in coming along with me please subscribe to my channel and hit the bell for notifications of my new videos.

This is me giving you guys a more interesting way to learn about personal finance because you have to learn about personal finance. There is no way about it. I have suffered from a lack of knowledge, trust me I have made all of the mistakes. But over years I’ve learnt and got better and I don’t make those mistakes anymore and I know so much more. And in knowing more I see a future where I, or people like myself don’t have to be anxious about money or have money insecurity. More than that I have a plan to get there. So I’m giving myself the challenge of documenting my Road to Wealth for the world to see. And hopefully I’ll pull a few people along with me.
